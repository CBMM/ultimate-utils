## Installing Ultimate-utils

I am a collection of useful code that Brando has collected through the years that has been useful accross his projects.

To use me get a copy of this repo (I recommend to fork it) clone it as usual in your workspace. 
Then install it in development mode (
google it if you don't know what it is or see the `modules_in_python.md`) with:

```
conda develop ~/ultimate-utils/ultimate-utils-project
```

or (pip command not tested)

```
pip install -e ~/ultimate-utils/ultimate-utils-project
```

depending on which package manager you are using.
I usually use conda.
